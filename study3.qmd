## Do Devices Change How We Use Mobile Banking?
In this chapter, I explore something that hasn't really been looked at before: Does the type of device someone uses affect how they adopt mobile banking?

In real life, using a smartphone is very different from using a smart wearable device like a smartwatch. 
These devices have different features, screen sizes, and even different ways users interact with them.
So, I wanted to find out:

> Do trust, security, and time-saving value of m-banking apps affect people differently depending on whether they use a smartphone or a wearable?
> Do demographics like age, gender, or income play a different role across devices?

I used survey data from over 18,000 people in Canada and ran a set of logistic regression models. 
I grouped people based on whether they use just a smartphone or both a smartphone and a wearable.
That's really because you don't use a smart wearable device as a standalone device.
What I found is that device type really matters:

* People who use smartphones care more about trust and security.
* In fact, people seem to perceive smartphones as more secure (they probably are?).
* People who use wearables care more about saving time and convenience.
* Some demographic factors (like education or age) influence adoption in different ways based on the device.

This work shows that mobile banking adoption isn't one-size-fits-all. 
If we want to understand how people really use these tools, and how banks should design better apps; we need to look at the devices they're using too.
By "we" I mean banks and researchers alike!
