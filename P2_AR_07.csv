(2003) unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut) with ict facilitators (i.e., reward and security) and ict inhibitors (i.e., risk and anxiety), as well as the recommendation factor. however, this study intends to fill the research gap by investigating and proving for the first time the impact of social influence, reward and anxiety factors on behavioral intention, the relationship between risk and anxiety and the impact of behavioral intention on recommendation via the application of confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling (sem) statistical techniques. the results reveal a number of differences regarding the factors that impact or not these two groups towards m-banking app adoption; thus, it provides new insights regarding m-banking app adoption in a slightly examined scientific field. thus, the study intends to assist the banking sector in better understanding their customers with the aim to formulate and apply customized m-business strategies and increase not only the adoption of m-banking apps but also the level of their further use."

Consequently, the study investigates the extent of DBC adoption, their usage benefits, the resulting service quality, and their aggregate impact on overall customer satisfaction with DBCs. The study measures customer satisfaction with digital technologies implemented in Lebanese banks during the most unstable period of Lebanese history. This study supported the deductive approach generating significantly interesting results by analyzing Spearman's correlations regarding DBC adoption and investigating customer satisfaction levels with DBCs showing satisfactory results such as high correlation for mobile banking adoption (0.544), internet banking (0.533), transactional call center (0.528) followed by ATM (0.455). A multiple linear regression study found a positive relationship between DBC adoption in Lebanese banks and overall customer satisfaction with DBCs with an adjusted R-squared value of 0.454 for DBC benefits and an adjusted R-squared value of 0.802 for DBC service quality in Lebanese banks on their customer satisfaction. The final conclusion is that banks should invest in DBCs and develop them as they are the major determinants leading to improved customer satisfaction through higher adoption/diversification rates, improved service quality levels and greater benefits. © Atef Harb, Mira Thoumy, Michel Yazbeck, 2022."

Cross-cultural and international comparative analysis can yield profound insights. In the future, segmentation analysis will determine the level of user maturity regarding digital payment adoption by identifying distinct user clusters (Chawla & Joshi, 2020a).

The study relies on the Actor-Network Theory as a lens through which to understand the interrelated factors that influence the elderly’s perception and adoption of mobile banking. The results reveal a low adoption of mobile banking by the elderly. In addition, it was evident that the barriers that influence the adoption of mobile banking by the elderly include a lack of information and understanding, security and trust issues, demographic factors, language, the complexity of mobile banking applications, and resistance to change. The identified important enablers towards the adoption of mobile banking include convenience, unlimited access, cost-effectiveness. The study proposes a mobile banking adoption model for the elderly and highlights the interrelated technical and non-technical factors influencing mobile banking adoption. Additionally, it offers design guiding principles aligned to the elderly’s needs and perceptions of mobile banking."

Argument Quality, valence, consistency and volume were considered eWOM triggers, and the conceptual model also included initial trust in m-banking as a mediator and consumer involvement in m-banking as a moderator. A total of 1153 useable surveys completed by the Indian users of social networking websites were used for analysis. The findings showed that of the triggers, argument quality, valence, and consistency enhance intention to adopt m-banking. These effects were mediated by initial trust in m-banking. The mediation effects of initial trust between valence – Intention varied between high and low consumer involvement in m-banking. These findings make several contributions to the literature on marketing communication, particularly to eWOM research and ELM theory. Practically, this study provides several recommendations to banks about how to use positive eWOM for motivating consumers to adopt m-banking."

According to the PLS-SEM results, the structural model shows that R2 is 0.757, which explains the variances in behavioral intention via all the constructs. Statistically, the intention to use e-payment systems is signiﬁcantly and positively inﬂuenced by performance and effort expectancies and social inﬂuence. In contrast, facilitation conditions are signiﬁcantly and negatively correlated with behavioral intention. This is attributed to consumers’ view of the infrastructure of Internet services, which does not contribute to the behavioral intention and acceptance of using electronic payment in Yemen. Contrary to expectations, age does not moderate the relationship between performance expectancy, social inﬂuence, and intention to use e-payment systems; hence, the related hypothesis was not supported. This study provides valuable suggestions for policymakers, designers, developers, and researchers, enabling them to better understand the critical aspects of using the electronic payment system.

To explore these elements, the current piece of work utilized the Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology and with the addition of component of perceived risk. The research utilized convenience sampling to collect data from the respondents having Jan Dhan account. The results show that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and perceived risk have a significant influence on intention to use mobile banking among financial inclusion stratum. Surprisingly, the facilitating conditions were found insignificant. The outcomes of the research can guide banks and technology houses to develop a more user-acceptable mobile banking system. Also, the outcome will help policymakers to enhance mobile banking system adoption for financial inclusion by considering influencing elements."

The empirical evidences reveal that Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Habit and Trust are significant and positively influencing the Behavioural Intention of the Mobile Banking whereas, Hedonic Motivation has significant and negative influence on Behavioural Intention of the Mobile Banking. This study concluded that banks should advertise and promote mobile banking through handsets and live demonstration counters at selected branches manned by a dedicated staff to adopt various promotional activities for enhancement in digital literacy and financial inclusion with other government schemes. Banks must extensively engage in the promotion of all Digital based initiatives launched by the Government of India and engage its customers to install banking Apps like BHIM, PhonePe, Payment Banks, etc. to facility effortless banking on their own palms.

The sample comprise of current users of online banking. Although earlier studies on technology adoption models have received considerable empirical validation, most of the studies did not consider moderating variables. Among those, which consider moderating variables, primarily explored are gender, age and income. By including other moderator variables in the model, we hope to lessen the inconsistencies found in past research studies. To test the moderating effect, two methods, viz. multiple linear regression and Fisher Z transformation are used. Results show that gender, age, qualification, experience, occupation, income and marital status were significant moderating variables. However, educational background did not show any moderating effect. Our results suggest that by extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Diffusion of Innovations (DoI) theory, the research provide insights into the factors influencing consumers’ attitude to adopt mobile banking applications. Besides, the results of moderating effect improve our understanding of the demographic differences, which influence the degree of mobile banking adoption. This study will help researchers and practitioners to come up with improved mobile adoption frameworks and applications with greater understanding of the influence of demographic factors."

The technology acceptance model (TAM) is being used widely in the m-banking literature and most of the reviewed studies are empirical with adequate sample size. This explains the increased usage of structural equation model (SEM).
