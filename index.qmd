Hi! Welcome to my dissertation website. 
I started my PhD in Management Science & Engineering at University of Waterloo in August 2021. 
This website will walk you through my entire project, which took me over 3 years to finish. 
I'm hoping this project can be used by others as inspiration, and hopefully, as a portfolio project for my own! 
I find a lot of this stuff fun! 
I'm also hoping to make everything super accessible to everyone, even if you're coming from no background in Statistics/Math/Computer Science.
